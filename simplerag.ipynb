We desire no conquest, no dominion. We seek no indemnities for ourselves, no material compensation for the sacrifices we shall freely make. We are but one of the champions of the rights of mankind. We shall be satisfied when those rights have been made as secure as the faith and the freedom of nations can make them.\\n\\nJust because we fight without rancor and without selfish object, seeking nothing for ourselves but what we shall wish to share with all free peoples, we shall, I feel confident, conduct our operations as belligerents without passion and ourselves observe with proud punctilio the principles of right and of fair play we profess to be fighting for.\\n\\nI have said nothing of the governments allied with the Imperial government of Germany because they have not made war upon us or challenged us to defend our right and our honor. The Austro-Hungarian government has, indeed, avowed its unqualified endorsement and acceptance of the reckless and lawless submarine warfare adopted now without disguise by the Imperial German government, and it has therefore not been possible for this government to receive Count Tarnowski, the ambassador recently accredited to this government by the Imperial and Royal government of Austria-Hungary; but that government has not actually engaged in warfare against citizens of the United States on the seas, and I take the liberty, for the present at least, of postponing a discussion of our relations with the authorities at Vienna. We enter this war only where we are clearly forced into it because there are no other means of defending our rights.\\n\\nIt will be all the easier for us to conduct ourselves as belligerents in a high spirit of right and fairness because we act without animus, not in enmity toward a people or with the desire to bring any injury or disadvantage upon them, but only in armed opposition to an irresponsible government which has thrown aside all considerations of humanity and of right and is running amuck. We are, let me say again, the sincere friends of the German people, and shall desire nothing so much as the early reestablishment of intimate relations of mutual advantage between us—however hard it may be for them, for the time being, to believe that this is spoken from our hearts.\\n\\nWe have borne with their present government through all these bitter months because of that friendship—exercising a patience and forbearance which would otherwise have been impossible. We shall, happily, still have an opportunity to prove that friendship in our daily attitude and actions toward the millions of men and women of German birth and native sympathy who live among us and share our life, and we shall be proud to prove it toward all who are in fact loyal to their neighbors and to the government in the hour of test. They are, most of them, as true and loyal Americans as if they had never known any other fealty or allegiance. They will be prompt to stand with us in rebuking and restraining the few who may be of a different mind and purpose. If there should be disloyalty, it will be dealt with with a firm hand of stern repression; but, if it lifts its head at all, it will lift it only here and there and without countenance except from a lawless and malignant few.\\n\\nIt is a distressing and oppressive duty, gentlemen of the Congress, which I have performed in thus addressing you. There are, it may be, many months of fiery trial and sacrifice ahead of us. It is a fearful thing to lead this great peaceful people into war, into the most terrible and disastrous of all wars, civilization itself seeming to be in the balance. But the right is more precious than peace, and we shall fight for the things which we have always carried nearest our hearts—for democracy, for the right of those who submit to authority to have a voice in their own governments, for the rights and liberties of small nations, for a universal dominion of right by such a concert of free peoples as shall bring peace and safety to all nations and make the world itself at last free.\\n\\nTo such a task we can dedicate our lives and our fortunes, everything that we are and everything that we have, with the pride of those who know that the day has come when America is privileged to spend her blood and her might for the principles that gave her birth and happiness and the peace which she has treasured.

Several proof-of-concepts demos, such as AutoGPT, GPT-Engineer and BabyAGI, serve as inspiring examples. The potentiality of LLM extends beyond generating well-written copies, stories, essays and programs; it can be framed as a powerful general problem solver.\\nAgent System Overview#\\nIn a LLM-powered autonomous agent system, LLM functions as the agent’s brain, complemented by several key components:\\n\\nPlanning\\n\\nSubgoal and decomposition: The agent breaks down large tasks into smaller, manageable subgoals, enabling efficient handling of complex tasks.\\nReflection and refinement: The agent can do self-criticism and self-reflection over past actions, learn from mistakes and refine them for future steps, thereby improving the quality of final results.\\n\\n\\nMemory\\n\\nShort-term memory: I would consider all the in-context learning (See Prompt Engineering) as utilizing short-term memory of the model to learn.\\nLong-term memory: This provides the agent with the capability to retain and recall (infinite) information over extended periods, often by leveraging an external vector store and fast retrieval.\\n\\n\\nTool use\\n\\nThe agent learns to call external APIs for extra information that is missing from the model weights (often hard to change after pre-training), including current information, code execution capability, access to proprietary information sources and more.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFig. 1. Overview of a LLM-powered autonomous agent system.\\nComponent One: Planning#\\nA complicated task usually involves many steps. An agent needs to know what they are and plan ahead.\\nTask Decomposition#\\nChain of thought (CoT; Wei et al. 2022) has become a standard prompting technique for enhancing model performance on complex tasks. The model is instructed to “think step by step” to utilize more test-time computation to decompose hard tasks into smaller and simpler steps. CoT transforms big tasks into multiple manageable tasks and shed lights into an interpretation of the model’s thinking process.\\nTree of Thoughts (Yao et al. 2023) extends CoT by exploring multiple reasoning possibilities at each step. It first decomposes the problem into multiple thought steps and generates multiple thoughts per step, creating a tree structure. The search process can be BFS (breadth-first search) or DFS (depth-first search) with each state evaluated by a classifier (via a prompt) or majority vote.\\nTask decomposition can be done (1) by LLM with simple prompting like \"Steps for XYZ.\\\\n1.\", \"What are the subgoals for achieving XYZ?\", (2) by using task-specific instructions; e.g. \"Write a story outline.\" for writing a novel, or (3) with human inputs.\\nAnother quite distinct approach, LLM+P (Liu et al. 2023), involves relying on an external classical planner to do long-horizon planning. This approach utilizes the Planning Domain Definition Language (PDDL) as an intermediate interface to describe the planning problem. In this process, LLM (1) translates the problem into “Problem PDDL”, then (2) requests a classical planner to generate a PDDL plan based on an existing “Domain PDDL”, and finally (3) translates the PDDL plan back into natural language. Essentially, the planning step is outsourced to an external tool, assuming the availability of domain-specific PDDL and a suitable planner which is common in certain robotic setups but not in many other domains.\\nSelf-Reflection#\\nSelf-reflection is a vital aspect that allows autonomous agents to improve iteratively by refining past action decisions and correcting previous mistakes. It plays a crucial role in real-world tasks where trial and error are inevitable.\\nReAct (Yao et al. 2023) integrates reasoning and acting within LLM by extending the action space to be a combination of task-specific discrete actions and the language space. The former enables LLM to interact with the environment (e.g. use Wikipedia search API), while the latter prompting LLM to generate reasoning traces in natural language.\\nThe ReAct prompt template incorporates explicit steps for LLM to think, roughly formatted as:\\nThought: ...\\nAction: ...\\nObservation: ...\\n... (Repeated many times)\\n\\nFig. 2.  Examples of reasoning trajectories for knowledge-intensive tasks (e.g. HotpotQA, FEVER) and decision-making tasks (e.g. AlfWorld Env, WebShop). (Image source: Yao et al. 2023).\\nIn both experiments on knowledge-intensive tasks and decision-making tasks, ReAct works better than the Act-only baseline where Thought: … step is removed.\\nReflexion (Shinn & Labash 2023) is a framework to equips agents with dynamic memory and self-reflection capabilities to improve reasoning skills. Reflexion has a standard RL setup, in which the reward model provides a simple binary reward and the action space follows the setup in ReAct where the task-specific action space is augmented with language to enable complex reasoning steps. After each action $a_t$, the agent computes a heuristic $h_t$ and optionally may decide to reset the environment to start a new trial depending on the self-reflection results.\\n\\nFig. 3. Illustration of the Reflexion framework. (Image source: Shinn & Labash, 2023)\\nThe heuristic function determines when the trajectory is inefficient or contains hallucination and should be stopped. Inefficient planning refers to trajectories that take too long without success. Hallucination is defined as encountering a sequence of consecutive identical actions that lead to the same observation in the environment.\\nSelf-reflection is created by showing two-shot examples to LLM and each example is a pair of (failed trajectory, ideal reflection for guiding future changes in the plan). Then reflections are added into the agent’s working memory, up to three, to be used as context for querying LLM.\\n\\nFig. 4. Experiments on AlfWorld Env and HotpotQA. Hallucination is a more common failure than inefficient planning in AlfWorld. (Image source: Shinn & Labash, 2023)\\nChain of Hindsight (CoH; Liu et al. 2023) encourages the model to improve on its own outputs by explicitly presenting it with a sequence of past outputs, each annotated with feedback. Human feedback data is a collection of $D_h = \\\\{(x, y_i , r_i , z_i)\\\\}_{i=1}^n$, where $x$ is the prompt, each $y_i$ is a model completion, $r_i$ is the human rating of $y_i$, and $z_i$ is the corresponding human-provided hindsight feedback. Assume the feedback tuples are ranked by reward, $r_n \\\\geq r_{n-1} \\\\geq \\\\dots \\\\geq r_1$ The process is supervised fine-tuning where the data is a sequence in the form of $\\\\tau_h = (x, z_i, y_i, z_j, y_j, \\\\dots, z_n, y_n)$, where $\\\\leq i \\\\leq j \\\\leq n$. The model is finetuned to only predict $y_n$ where conditioned on the sequence prefix, such that the model can self-reflect to produce better output based on the feedback sequence. The model can optionally receive multiple rounds of instructions with human annotators at test time.\\nTo avoid overfitting, CoH adds a regularization term to maximize the log-likelihood of the pre-training dataset. To avoid shortcutting and copying (because there are many common words in feedback sequences), they randomly mask 0% - 5% of past tokens during training.\\nThe training dataset in their experiments is a combination of WebGPT comparisons, summarization from human feedback and human preference dataset.\\n\\nFig. 5. After fine-tuning with CoH, the model can follow instructions to produce outputs with incremental improvement in a sequence. (Image source: Liu et al. 2023)\\nThe idea of CoH is to present a history of sequentially improved outputs  in context and train the model to take on the trend to produce better outputs. Algorithm Distillation (AD; Laskin et al. 2023) applies the same idea to cross-episode trajectories in reinforcement learning tasks, where an algorithm is encapsulated in a long history-conditioned policy. Considering that an agent interacts with the environment many times and in each episode the agent gets a little better, AD concatenates this learning history and feeds that into the model. Hence we should expect the next predicted action to lead to better performance than previous trials. The goal is to learn the process of RL instead of training a task-specific policy itself.\\n\\nFig. 6. Illustration of how Algorithm Distillation (AD) works. (Image source: Laskin et al. 2023).\\nThe paper hypothesizes that any algorithm that generates a set of learning histories can be distilled into a neural network by performing behavioral cloning over actions. The history data is generated by a set of source policies, each trained for a specific task. At the training stage, during each RL run, a random task is sampled and a subsequence of multi-episode history is used for training, such that the learned policy is task-agnostic.\\nIn reality, the model has limited context window length, so episodes should be short enough to construct multi-episode history. Multi-episodic contexts of 2-4 episodes are necessary to learn a near-optimal in-context RL algorithm. The emergence of in-context RL requires long enough context.\\nIn comparison with three baselines, including ED (expert distillation, behavior cloning with expert trajectories instead of learning history), source policy (used for generating trajectories for distillation by UCB), RL^2 (Duan et al. 2017; used as upper bound since it needs online RL), AD demonstrates in-context RL with performance getting close to RL^2 despite only using offline RL and learns much faster than other baselines. When conditioned on partial training history of the source policy, AD also improves much faster than ED baseline.\\n\\nFig. 7. Comparison of AD, ED, source policy and RL^2 on environments that require memory and exploration. Only binary reward is assigned. The source policies are trained with A3C for \"dark\" environments and DQN for watermaze.(Image source: Laskin et al. 2023)\\nComponent Two: Memory#\\n(Big thank you to ChatGPT for helping me draft this section. I’ve learned a lot about the human brain and data structure for fast MIPS in my conversations with ChatGPT.)\\nTypes of Memory#\\nMemory can be defined as the processes used to acquire, store, retain, and later retrieve information. There are several types of memory in human brains.\\n\\n\\nSensory Memory: This is the earliest stage of memory, providing the ability to retain impressions of sensory information (visual, auditory, etc) after the original stimuli have ended. Sensory memory typically only lasts for up to a few seconds. Subcategories include iconic memory (visual), echoic memory (auditory), and haptic memory (touch).\\n\\n\\nShort-Term Memory (STM) or Working Memory: It stores information that we are currently aware of and needed to carry out complex cognitive tasks such as learning and reasoning. Short-term memory is believed to have the capacity of about 7 items (Miller 1956) and lasts for 20-30 seconds.\\n\\n\\nLong-Term Memory (LTM): Long-term memory can store information for a remarkably long time, ranging from a few days to decades, with an essentially unlimited storage capacity. There are two subtypes of LTM:\\n\\nExplicit / declarative memory: This is memory of facts and events, and refers to those memories that can be consciously recalled, including episodic memory (events and experiences) and semantic memory (facts and concepts).\\nImplicit / procedural memory: This type of memory is unconscious and involves skills and routines that are performed automatically, like riding a bike or typing on a keyboard.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFig. 8. Categorization of human memory.\\nWe can roughly consider the following mappings:\\n\\nSensory memory as learning embedding representations for raw inputs, including text, image or other modalities;\\nShort-term memory as in-context learning. It is short and finite, as it is restricted by the finite context window length of Transformer.\\nLong-term memory as the external vector store that the agent can attend to at query time, accessible via fast retrieval.\\n\\nMaximum Inner Product Search (MIPS)#\\nThe external memory can alleviate the restriction of finite attention span.  A standard practice is to save the embedding representation of information into a vector store database that can support fast maximum inner-product search (MIPS). To optimize the retrieval speed, the common choice is the approximate nearest neighbors (ANN)\\u200b algorithm to return approximately top k nearest neighbors to trade off a little accuracy lost for a huge speedup.\\nA couple common choices of ANN algorithms for fast MIPS:\\n\\nLSH (Locality-Sensitive Hashing): It introduces a hashing function such that similar input items are mapped to the same buckets with high probability, where the number of buckets is much smaller than the number of inputs.\\nANNOY (Approximate Nearest Neighbors Oh Yeah): The core data structure are random projection trees, a set of binary trees where each non-leaf node represents a hyperplane splitting the input space into half and each leaf stores one data point. Trees are built independently and at random, so to some extent, it mimics a hashing function. ANNOY search happens in all the trees to iteratively search through the half that is closest to the query and then aggregates the results. The idea is quite related to KD tree but a lot more scalable.\\nHNSW (Hierarchical Navigable Small World): It is inspired by the idea of small world networks where most nodes can be reached by any other nodes within a small number of steps; e.g. “six degrees of separation” feature of social networks. HNSW builds hierarchical layers of these small-world graphs, where the bottom layers contain the actual data points. The layers in the middle create shortcuts to speed up search. When performing a search, HNSW starts from a random node in the top layer and navigates towards the target. When it can’t get any closer, it moves down to the next layer, until it reaches the bottom layer. Each move in the upper layers can potentially cover a large distance in the data space, and each move in the lower layers refines the search quality.\\nFAISS (Facebook AI Similarity Search): It operates on the assumption that in high dimensional space, distances between nodes follow a Gaussian distribution and thus there should exist clustering of data points. FAISS applies vector quantization by partitioning the vector space into clusters and then refining the quantization within clusters. Search first looks for cluster candidates with coarse quantization and then further looks into each cluster with finer quantization.\\nScaNN (Scalable Nearest Neighbors): The main innovation in ScaNN is anisotropic vector quantization. It quantizes a data point $x_i$ to $\\\\tilde{x}_i$ such that the inner product $\\\\langle q, x_i \\\\rangle$ is as similar to the original distance of $\\\\angle q, \\\\tilde{x}_i$ as possible, instead of picking the closet quantization centroid points.\\n\\n\\nFig. 9. Comparison of MIPS algorithms, measured in recall@10. (Image source: Google Blog, 2020)\\nCheck more MIPS algorithms and performance comparison in ann-benchmarks.com.\\nComponent Three: Tool Use#\\nTool use is a remarkable and distinguishing characteristic of human beings. We create, modify and utilize external objects to do things that go beyond our physical and cognitive limits. Equipping LLMs with external tools can significantly extend the model capabilities.\\n\\nFig. 10. A picture of a sea otter using rock to crack open a seashell, while floating in the water. While some other animals can use tools, the complexity is not comparable with humans. (Image source: Animals using tools)\\nMRKL (Karpas et al. 2022), short for “Modular Reasoning, Knowledge and Language”, is a neuro-symbolic architecture for autonomous agents. A MRKL system is proposed to contain a collection of “expert” modules and the general-purpose LLM works as a router to route inquiries to the best suitable expert module. These modules can be neural (e.g. deep learning models) or symbolic (e.g. math calculator, currency converter, weather API).\\nThey did an experiment on fine-tuning LLM to call a calculator, using arithmetic as a test case. Their experiments showed that it was harder to solve verbal math problems than explicitly stated math problems because LLMs (7B Jurassic1-large model) failed to extract the right arguments for the basic arithmetic reliably. The results highlight when the external symbolic tools can work reliably, knowing when to and how to use the tools are crucial, determined by the LLM capability.\\nBoth TALM (Tool Augmented Language Models; Parisi et al. 2022) and Toolformer (Schick et al. 2023) fine-tune a LM to learn to use external tool APIs. The dataset is expanded based on whether a newly added API call annotation can improve the quality of model outputs. See more details in the “External APIs” section of Prompt Engineering.\\nChatGPT Plugins and OpenAI API  function calling are good examples of LLMs augmented with tool use capability working in practice. The collection of tool APIs can be provided by other developers (as in Plugins) or self-defined (as in function calls).\\nHuggingGPT (Shen et al. 2023) is a framework to use ChatGPT as the task planner to select models available in HuggingFace platform according to the model descriptions and summarize the response based on the execution results.\\n\\nFig. 11. Illustration of how HuggingGPT works. (Image source: Shen et al. 2023)\\nThe system comprises of 4 stages:\\n(1) Task planning: LLM works as the brain and parses the user requests into multiple tasks. There are four attributes associated with each task: task type, ID, dependencies, and arguments. They use few-shot examples to guide LLM to do task parsing and planning.\\nInstruction:\\n\\nThe AI assistant can parse user input to several tasks: [{\"task\": task, \"id\", task_id, \"dep\": dependency_task_ids, \"args\": {\"text\": text, \"image\": URL, \"audio\": URL, \"video\": URL}}]. The \"dep\" field denotes the id of the previous task which generates a new resource that the current task relies on. A special tag \"-task_id\" refers to the generated text image, audio and video in the dependency task with id as task_id. The task MUST be selected from the following options: {{ Available Task List }}. There is a logical relationship between tasks, please note their order. If the user input can\\'t be parsed, you need to reply empty JSON. Here are several cases for your reference: {{ Demonstrations }}. The chat history is recorded as {{ Chat History }}. From this chat history, you can find the path of the user-mentioned resources for your task planning.\\n\\n(2) Model selection: LLM distributes the tasks to expert models, where the request is framed as a multiple-choice question. LLM is presented with a list of models to choose from. Due to the limited context length, task type based filtration is needed.\\nInstruction:\\n\\nGiven the user request and the call command, the AI assistant helps the user to select a suitable model from a list of models to process the user request. The AI assistant merely outputs the model id of the most appropriate model. The output must be in a strict JSON format: \"id\": \"id\", \"reason\": \"your detail reason for the choice\". We have a list of models for you to choose from {{ Candidate Models }}. Please select one model from the list.\\n\\n(3) Task execution: Expert models execute on the specific tasks and log results.\\nInstruction:\\n\\nWith the input and the inference results, the AI assistant needs to describe the process and results. The previous stages can be formed as - User Input: {{ User Input }}, Task Planning: {{ Tasks }}, Model Selection: {{ Model Assignment }}, Task Execution: {{ Predictions }}. You must first answer the user\\'s request in a straightforward manner. Then describe the task process and show your analysis and model inference results to the user in the first person. If inference results contain a file path, must tell the user the complete file path.\\n\\n(4) Response generation: LLM receives the execution results and provides summarized results to users.\\nTo put HuggingGPT into real world usage, a couple challenges need to solve: (1) Efficiency improvement is needed as both LLM inference rounds and interactions with other models slow down the process; (2) It relies on a long context window to communicate over complicated task content; (3) Stability improvement of LLM outputs and external model services.\\nAPI-Bank (Li et al. 2023) is a benchmark for evaluating the performance of tool-augmented LLMs. It contains 53 commonly used API tools, a complete tool-augmented LLM workflow, and 264 annotated dialogues that involve 568 API calls. The selection of APIs is quite diverse, including search engines, calculator, calendar queries, smart home control, schedule management, health data management, account authentication workflow and more. Because there are a large number of APIs, LLM first has access to API search engine to find the right API to call and then uses the corresponding documentation to make a call.\\n\\nFig. 12. Pseudo code of how LLM makes an API call in API-Bank. (Image source: Li et al. 2023)\\nIn the API-Bank workflow, LLMs need to make a couple of decisions and at each step we can evaluate how accurate that decision is. Decisions include:\\n\\nWhether an API call is needed.\\nIdentify the right API to call: if not good enough, LLMs need to iteratively modify the API inputs (e.g. deciding search keywords for Search Engine API).\\nResponse based on the API results: the model can choose to refine and call again if results are not satisfied.\\n\\nThis benchmark evaluates the agent’s tool use capabilities at three levels:\\n\\nLevel-1 evaluates the ability to call the API. Given an API’s description, the model needs to determine whether to call a given API, call it correctly, and respond properly to API returns.\\nLevel-2 examines the ability to retrieve the API. The model needs to search for possible APIs that may solve the user’s requirement and learn how to use them by reading documentation.\\nLevel-3 assesses the ability to plan API beyond retrieve and call. Given unclear user requests (e.g. schedule group meetings, book flight/hotel/restaurant for a trip), the model may have to conduct multiple API calls to solve it.\\n\\nCase Studies#\\nScientific Discovery Agent#\\nChemCrow (Bran et al. 2023) is a domain-specific example in which LLM is augmented with 13 expert-designed tools to accomplish tasks across organic synthesis, drug discovery, and materials design. The workflow, implemented in LangChain, reflects what was previously described in the ReAct and MRKLs and combines CoT reasoning with tools relevant to the tasks:\\n\\nThe LLM is provided with a list of tool names, descriptions of their utility, and details about the expected input/output.\\nIt is then instructed to answer a user-given prompt using the tools provided when necessary. The instruction suggests the model to follow the ReAct format - Thought, Action, Action Input, Observation.\\n\\nOne interesting observation is that while the LLM-based evaluation concluded that GPT-4 and ChemCrow perform nearly equivalently, human evaluations with experts oriented towards the completion and chemical correctness of the solutions showed that ChemCrow outperforms GPT-4 by a large margin. This indicates a potential problem with using LLM to evaluate its own performance on domains that requires deep expertise. The lack of expertise may cause LLMs not knowing its flaws and thus cannot well judge the correctness of task results.\\nBoiko et al. (2023) also looked into LLM-empowered agents for scientific discovery, to handle autonomous design, planning, and performance of complex scientific experiments. This agent can use tools to browse the Internet, read documentation, execute code, call robotics experimentation APIs and leverage other LLMs.\\nFor example, when requested to \"develop a novel anticancer drug\", the model came up with the following reasoning steps:\\n\\ninquired about current trends in anticancer drug discovery;\\nselected a target;\\nrequested a scaffold targeting these compounds;\\nOnce the compound was identified, the model attempted its synthesis.\\n\\nThey also discussed the risks, especially with illicit drugs and bioweapons. They developed a test set containing a list of known chemical weapon agents and asked the agent to synthesize them. 4 out of 11 requests (36%) were accepted to obtain a synthesis solution and the agent attempted to consult documentation to execute the procedure. 7 out of 11 were rejected and among these 7 rejected cases, 5 happened after a Web search while 2 were rejected based on prompt only.\\nGenerative Agents Simulation#\\nGenerative Agents (Park, et al. 2023) is super fun experiment where 25 virtual characters, each controlled by a LLM-powered agent, are living and interacting in a sandbox environment, inspired by The Sims. Generative agents create believable simulacra of human behavior for interactive applications.\\nThe design of generative agents combines LLM with memory, planning and reflection mechanisms to enable agents to behave conditioned on past experience, as well as to interact with other agents.\\n\\nMemory stream: is a long-term memory module (external database) that records a comprehensive list of agents’ experience in natural language.\\n\\nEach element is an observation, an event directly provided by the agent.\\n- Inter-agent communication can trigger new natural language statements.\\n\\n\\nRetrieval model: surfaces the context to inform the agent’s behavior, according to relevance, recency and importance.\\n\\nRecency: recent events have higher scores\\nImportance: distinguish mundane from core memories. Ask LM directly.\\nRelevance: based on how related it is to the current situation / query.\\n\\n\\nReflection mechanism: synthesizes memories into higher level inferences over time and guides the agent’s future behavior. They are higher-level summaries of past events (<- note that this is a bit different from self-reflection above)\\n\\nPrompt LM with 100 most recent observations and to generate 3 most salient high-level questions given a set of observations/statements. Then ask LM to answer those questions.\\n\\n\\nPlanning & Reacting: translate the reflections and the environment information into actions\\n\\nPlanning is essentially in order to optimize believability at the moment vs in time.\\nPrompt template: {Intro of an agent X}. Here is X\\'s plan today in broad strokes: 1)\\nRelationships between agents and observations of one agent by another are all taken into consideration for planning and reacting.\\nEnvironment information is present in a tree structure.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFig. 13. The generative agent architecture. (Image source: Park et al. 2023)\\nThis fun simulation results in emergent social behavior, such as information diffusion, relationship memory (e.g. two agents continuing the conversation topic) and coordination of social events (e.g. host a party and invite many others).\\nProof-of-Concept Examples#\\nAutoGPT has drawn a lot of attention into the possibility of setting up autonomous agents with LLM as the main controller.

The design of the system has to work with this limited communication bandwidth, while mechanisms like self-reflection to learn from past mistakes would benefit a lot from long or infinite context windows. Although vector stores and retrieval can provide access to a larger knowledge pool, their representation power is not as powerful as full attention.\\n\\n\\nChallenges in long-term planning and task decomposition: Planning over a lengthy history and effectively exploring the solution space remain challenging. LLMs struggle to adjust plans when faced with unexpected errors, making them less robust compared to humans who learn from trial and error.\\n\\n\\nReliability of natural language interface: Current agent system relies on natural language as an interface between LLMs and external components such as memory and tools. However, the reliability of model outputs is questionable, as LLMs may make formatting errors and occasionally exhibit rebellious behavior (e.g. refuse to follow an instruction). Consequently, much of the agent demo code focuses on parsing model output.\\n\\n\\nCitation#\\nCited as:\\n\\nWeng, Lilian. (Jun 2023). “LLM-powered Autonomous Agents”.

Indeed, more people were killed by gang violence in 2017 in\\nChicago than in all U.S. special operations forces across a decade’ s worth\\nof fighting in Iraq and then Syria. At the center of the strife is social media.\\n“Most of the gang disputes have nothing to do with drug sales, or gang\\nterritory , and everything to do with settling personal scores,” explains\\nChicago alderman Joe Moore, who witnessed one of the shootings of Y oung\\nPappy . “Insults that are hurled on the social media.”\\nMuch of this violence starts with gangs’ use of social media to\\n“cybertag” and “cyberbang.” T agging is an update of the old-school\\npractice of spray-painting graf fiti to mark territory or insult a rival. The\\n“cyber” version is used to promote your gang or to start a flame war by\\nincluding another gang’ s name in a post or mentioning a street within a rival\\ngang’ s territory . These online skirmishes escalate quickly . Anyone who\\nposts about a person or a street belonging to a rival gang is making an\\nonline show of disrespect. Such a post is viewed as an invitation to “post\\nup,” or retaliate.\\nDigital sociologists describe how social media creates a new reality “no\\nlonger limited to the perceptual horizon,” in which an online feud can seem\\njust as real as a face-to-face ar gument. The dif ference in being online,\\nhowever , is that now seemingly the whole world is witnessing whether you\\naccept the challenge or not. This phenomenon plays out at every level, and\\nnot just in killings; 80 percent of the fights that break out in Chicago\\nschools are now instigated online.\\nIn time, these online skirmishes move to the “bang,” sometimes called\\n“Facebook drilling.” (There are regional variants of this term. In Los\\nAngeles, for instance, they use the descriptor “wallbanging.”) This is when\\na threat is made via social media.

In the past, gangs battled with\\ntheir neighbors; the “turf war” literally was about the border of their\\nneighborhoods. Now , as journalist Ben Austen explained in an exhaustive\\ninvestigation of the lives of young Chicago gangbangers, “the quarrel might\\nbe with not just the Facebook driller a few blocks away but also the haters\\nten miles north or west.” Y ou can be anywhere in the city and never have\\nmet the shooter , but “what started as a provocation online winds up with\\nsomeone getting drilled in real life.”\\nThe decentralized technology thus allows any individual to ignite this\\ncycle of violence. Y et by throwing down the gauntlet in such a public way ,\\nonline threats have to be backed up not just by the individual, but by the\\ngroup as well. If someone is fronted and doesn’ t reply , it’ s not just the gang\\nmember but the gang as a whole that loses status. The outcome is that\\nanyone can start a feud online, but everyone has a collective responsibility\\nto make sure it gets consummated in the real world.\\nOne death can quickly beget another . Sometimes, the online\\nmemorialization of the victim inspires vows of revenge; other times, the\\nkillers use it to taunt and troll to further bloodshed. One teen explained,\\n“W ell, if you’re a rival gang, I’ll probably send you a picture of your dead\\nboy’ s candles (at a public memorial) . . . or I’ll take a picture by your block\\nwith a gun and say , ‘Where you at?’ It depends on how you take it . . . and\\nthings will go from there.”\\nWhat has taken place in Chicago has been replicated across the nation. In\\nLos Angeles, for instance, gangs use social media not just to beef on a new\\nscale, but also to or ganize their chapters, recruit across the country , and\\neven negotiate drug and arms deals with gangsters in other nations. Robert\\nRubin is a former gang member who now runs a gang intervention group\\ncalled Advocates for Peace and Urban Unity . W ith mournful eyes and a\\ngoatee flecked with grey , he looks like a poet. He summarized the problem\\nbest.

And politics will always lie at the heart of\\nviolent conflict, the two inherently linked. “The main lines along which\\nmilitary events progress, and to which they are restricted, are political lines\\nthat continue throughout the war into the subsequent peace.”\\nIn other words, Clausewitz thought, war is part of the same continuum\\nthat includes trade, diplomacy , and all the other interactions that take place\\nbetween peoples and governments. This theory flew in the face of the\\nbeliefs of older generations of soldiers and military theorists, who viewed\\nwar as a sort of “on/of f” switch that pulled combatants into an alternate\\nreality governed by a dif ferent set of rules. T o Clausewitz, war is simply\\nanother way to get something you want: an act of force to compel an enemy\\nto your will.\\nW inning is a matter of finding and neutralizing an adversary’ s “center of\\ngravity .” This is often a rival’ s army , whose destruction usually ends its\\nability to fight. But routing an army is not always the most ef fective path.\\n“The moral elements are among the most important in war ,” Clausewitz\\nwrote. “They constitute the spirit that permeates war as a whole . . . They\\nestablish a close af finity with the will that moves and leads the whole mass\\nof force.” Figure out how to shatter a rival’ s spirit, and you might win the\\nwar , while avoiding the enemy army entirely .\\nEasier said than done. Modern warfare has seen numerous ef forts to\\ntar get and drain an enemy’ s spirit, almost never with success. In W orld W ar\\nII, Britain bore the Blitz, years of indiscriminate bombing by German\\nplanes and rockets that sought to force the nation to capitulate. The British\\ninstead turned what W inston Churchill called their “Darkest Hour” into\\ntriumph. Similar logic drove the United States’ Rolling Thunder bombing\\ncampaign against the cities and industry of North V ietnam during the late\\n1960s. U.S. warplanes dropped more than 6.5 million tons of bombs and\\nkilled tens of thousands of people.

Over decades of growth, the\\ninternet has become the preeminent medium of global communication,\\ncommerce, and politics. It has empowered not just new leaders and groups,\\nbut a new corporate order that works constantly to expand it. This pattern\\nresembles the trajectory of the telegraph, telephone, radio, and television\\nbefore it. But the rise of social media has allowed the internet to surpass\\nthose revolutions. It is now truly  global and instantaneous—the ultimate\\ncombination of individual connection and mass transmission. Y et\\ntumultuous as the past few years have been, social media—and the\\nrevolution it represents—is only now starting to flex its muscles. Half the\\nworld has yet to come online and join the fray .\\nSecond, the internet has become a battlefield.  As integral as the internet\\nhas become to business and social life, it is now equally indispensable to\\nmilitaries and governments, authoritarians and activists, and spies and\\nsoldiers. They all use it to wage wars that observe no clear borders. The\\nresult is that every battle seems personal, but every conflict is global.\\nThir d, this battlefield changes how conflicts ar e fought.  Social media has\\nrendered secrets of any consequence essentially impossible to keep. Y et\\nbecause virality can overwhelm truth, what is known can be reshaped.\\n“Power” on this battlefield is thus measured not by physical strength or\\nhigh-tech hardware, but by the command of attention. The result is a contest\\nof psychological and algorithmic manipulation, fought through an endless\\nchurn of competing viral events.\\nFourth, this battle changes what “war” means.  W inning these online\\nbattles doesn’ t just win the web, but wins the world. Each ephemeral\\nvictory drives events in the physical realm, from seemingly inconsequential\\ncelebrity feuds to history-changing elections. These outcomes become the\\nbasis of the next inevitable battle for online truth, further blurring the\\ndistinction between actions in the physical and digital realms. The result is\\nthat on the internet, “war” and “politics” have begun to fuse, obeying the\\nsame rules and inhabiting the same spectrum; their tactics and even players\\nare increasingly indistinguishable.

It would be the most essential form of information itself. The\\n“binary information digit,” or “bit,” had first been proposed in 1948 by\\nClaude Shannon of Bell Labs. The bit was the smallest possible unit of data,\\nexisting in either an “on” or “of f” state. By stringing bits together , complex\\ninstructions could be sent through computers, with perfect accuracy . As\\nacclaimed physicist John Archibald Wheeler observed, breaking\\ninformation into bits made it possible to convey anything.  “Every particle,\\nevery field of force, even the space-time continuum itself,” Wheeler wrote,\\n“derives its function, its meaning, its very existence, from answers to yes-\\nno questions, binary choices, bits.”\\nBy arranging bits into “packets” of information and establishing a system\\nfor sending and receiving them (packet switching), it was theoretically\\npossible for computers to relay instructions instantly , over any conceivable\\ndistance.

When a team of researchers proposed a similar idea to\\nA T&T in 1965, they were bluntly rejected. “Damn it!” exclaimed one\\nexecutive. “W e’re not going to set up a competitor to ourselves!”\\nLuckily , Licklider and T aylor were in a position to help make their vision\\nof computers exchanging bits of information a reality . The two were\\nemployees of the Pentagon’ s Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARP A).\\nAfter the surprise of the Sputnik space satellite launch in 1957, ARP A was\\nestablished in 1958 to maintain U.S. parity with Soviet science and\\ntechnology research.

A\\nnetwork could spread the load and make it easier on everyone. So a project\\nwas funded to transform the Inter galactic Computer Network into reality . It\\nwas called ARP ANET .\\nOn October 29, 1969, ARP ANET came to life when a computer at UCLA\\nwas linked to a computer at Stanford University . The bits of information on\\none machine were broken down into packets and then sent to another\\nmachine, traveling across 350 miles of leased telephone wire. There, the\\npackets were re-formed into a message.

This limitation made information, in any form,\\nthe scarcest of commodities.\\nThe status quo stood for almost 4,000 years, until the advent of the\\nprinting press.

Instead, the printing press revolution\\nbegan in Europe in around 1438, thanks to a former goldsmith, Johannes\\nGutenber g, who began experimenting with movable type. By 1450, he was\\npeddling his mass-produced Bibles across Germany and France.\\nPredictably , the powers of the day tried to control this disruptive new\\ntechnology . The monks and scribes, who had spent decades honing their\\nhand-copying techniques, called for rulers to ban it, ar guing that mass\\nproduction would strangle the “spirituality” of the copying process. Their\\ncampaign failed, however , when, short on time and money , they resorted to\\nprinting their own pamphlet on one of Gutenber g’ s new inventions. W ithin\\na century , the press became both accessible and indispensable. Once a rare\\ncommodity , books—some 200 million of them—were now circulating\\nwidely in Europe.\\nIn what would become a familiar pattern, the new technology\\ntransformed not just communications but war , politics, and the world. In\\n1517, a geopolitical match was struck when a German monk named Martin\\nLuther wrote a letter laying out 95 problems in the Catholic Church. Where\\nLuther ’ s ar guments might once have been ignored, the printing press\\nallowed his ideas to reach well beyond the bishop to whom he penned the\\nletter . By the time the pope heard about the troublesome monk and sought\\nto excommunicate him, Luther had reproduced his 95 complaints in 30\\ndif ferent pamphlets and sold 300,000 copies. The result was the Protestant\\nReformation, which would fuel two centuries of war and reshape the map of\\nEurope.\\nThe technology would also create new powers in society and place the\\nold ones under unwelcome scrutiny . In 1605, a German printer named\\nJohann Carolus found a way to use his press’ s downtime by publishing a\\nweekly collection of “news advice.” In publishing the first newspaper ,\\nCarolus created a new profession. The “press” sold information itself to\\ncustomers, creating a popular market model that had never before existed.\\nBut in the search to profit from news, truth sometimes fell by the wayside.\\nFor instance, the New-England Courant,  among the first American\\nnewspapers, published a series of especially witty letters by a “Mrs. Silence\\nDogood” in 1722. The actual writer was a 16-year -old apprentice named\\nBenjamin Franklin, making him—among many other things—the founding\\nfather of fake news in America.', metadata={'source': 'Like_War_The_Weaponization_of_Social_Media.pdf', 'page': 34}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='Y et the spread of information, true or false, was limited by the prevailing\\ntransportation of the day . In ancient Greece, the warrior Phei-dippides\\nfamously ran 25 miles from Marathon to Athens to deliver word of the\\nGreeks’ victory over the Persian army . (The 26.2-mile distance of the\\nmodern “marathon” dates from the 1908 Olympics, where the British royal\\nfamily insisted on extending the route to meet their viewing stands.) It was\\na race to share the news that would literally kill him. When Pheidippides\\nfinally sprinted up the steps of Athens’ s grand Acropolis, he cried out to the\\nanxious city leaders gathered there, “Nikomen! W e are victorious!” And\\nthen, as the poet Robert Browning would write 2,400 years later , he\\ncollapsed and died, “joy in his blood bursting his heart.”\\nFrom the dawn of history , any such messages, important or not, could\\nonly be delivered by hand or word of mouth (save the occasional adventure\\nwith carrier pigeons). This placed a sharp upper bound on the speed of\\ncommunication. The Roman postal service ( cursus publicus,  “the public\\nway”), established at the beginning of the first millennium CE , set a record\\nof roughly fifty miles per day that would stand essentially unchallenged\\nuntil the advent of the railroad. News of world-changing events—the death\\nof an emperor or start of a war—could only travel as fast as a horse could\\ngallop or a ship could sail. As late as 1815, thousands of British soldiers\\nwould be mowed down at the Battle of New Orleans simply because tidings\\nof a peace treaty ending the W ar of 1812—signed two weeks earlier—had\\nyet to traverse the Atlantic.\\nThe world changed decisively in 1844, the year Samuel Morse\\nsuccessfully tested his telegraph (from the Latin words meaning “far\\nwriter”). By harnessing the emer ging science of electricity , the telegraph\\nended the tyranny of distance. It also showed the important role of\\ngovernment in any communication technology now able to extend across\\npolitical boundaries.

President\\nJames Buchanan captured the feeling best when marking the laying of the\\nfirst transatlantic cable between the United States and Britain, in 1858. He\\nexpressed the belief that the telegraph would “prove to be a bond of\\nperpetual peace and friendship between the kindred nations, and an\\ninstrument designed . . . to dif fuse religion, liberty , and law throughout the\\nworld.” W ithin days, that transatlantic cable of perpetual peace was instead\\nbeing used to send military orders.\\nLike the printing press before it, the telegraph quickly became an\\nimportant new tool of conflict, which would also transform it. Beginning in\\nthe Crimean W ar (1853–1856), broad instructions, traveling weeks by sea,\\nwere replaced—to the lament of of ficers in the field—by micromanaging\\nbattle orders sent by cable from the tearooms of London to the battlefields\\nof Russia. Some militaries proved more ef fective in exploiting the new\\ntechnology than others. In the W ars of German Unification (1864–1871),\\nPrussian generals masterfully coordinated far -flung forces to the baf flement\\nof their foes, using real-time communications by telegraph wire to replace\\nhorseback couriers. As a result, the telegraph also spurred huge growth in\\nwar ’ s reach and scale. In the American Civil W ar (1861–1865), Confederate\\nand Union soldiers, each seeking an edge over the other , laid some 15,000\\nmiles of telegraph wire.\\nThe telegraph also reshaped the public experience and perception of\\nconflict.

His\\n“yellow journalism” (named for the tint of the comics in two competing\\nNew Y ork dailies, Hearst’ s New Y ork Journal  and Joseph Pulitzer ’ s New\\nY ork W orld ) was the kind of wild rumormongering American readers\\ncouldn’ t get enough of—and that helped spark the Spanish-American W ar\\nof 1898. When one of his photographers begged to return home from\\nSpanish-controlled Cuba because nothing was happening, Hearst cabled\\nback: “Please remain. Y ou furnish the pictures and I’ll furnish the war .”\\nConcern over the issue of telegraphed “fake news” grew so great that the St.\\nPaul Globe  even changed its motto that year: “Live News, Latest News,\\nReliable News—No Fake W ar News.”\\nThe electric wire of the telegraph, though, could only speak in dots and\\ndashes. T o use them required not just the infrastructure of a telegraph of fice,\\nbut a trained expert to operate the machine and translate its coded messages\\nfor you. Alexander Graham Bell, an amateur tinkerer whose day job was\\nteaching the deaf, changed this with the telephone in 1876. Sending sound\\nby wire meant users could communicate with each other , even in their\\nof fices and homes. W ithin a year of its invention, the first phone was put in\\nthe White House. The number to call President Rutherford B. Hayes was\\n“1,” as the only other phone line linked to it was at the T reasury\\nDepartment. The telephone also empowered a new class of oligarchs. Bell’ s\\ninvention was patented and soon monopolized by Bell T elephone, later\\nrenamed the American T elephone and T elegraph Company (A T&T). Nearly\\nall phone conversations in the United States would be routed through this\\none company for the next century .\\nT elegraphs and phones had a crucial flaw , though. They shrank the time\\nand simplified the means by which a message could travel a great distance,\\nbut they did so only between two points, linked by wire. Guglielmo\\nMarconi, a 20-year -old Irish-Italian tinkering in a secret lab in his parents’\\nattic, would be the first to build a working “wireless telegraphy” system, in\\n1894.\\nMarconi’ s radio made him a conflicted man. He claimed that radio would\\nbe “a herald of peace and civilization between nations.” At the same time,\\nhe aggressively peddled it to every military he could. He sold it to the\\nBritish navy in 1901 and convinced the Belgian government to use it in the\\nbrutal colonization of the Congo.

       " Document(page_content='Radio’ s promise, however , went well beyond connecting two points\\nacross land or sea. By eliminating the need for wire, radio freed\\ncommunications in a manner akin to the printing press. One person could\\nspeak to thousands or even millions of people at once. Unlike the telegraph,\\nwhich conveyed just dots and dashes, radio waves could carry the human\\nvoice and the entire musical spectrum, turning them into the conveyor of\\nnot only mass information but also mass entertainment.\\nThe first radio “broadcast” took place in 1906, when an American\\nengineer played “O Holy Night” on his violin. By 1924, there were an\\nestimated 3 million radio sets and 20 million radio listeners in the United\\nStates alone. Quite quickly , radio waves collided with politics. Smart\\npoliticians began to realize that radio had shattered the old political norms.\\nSpeeches over the waves became a new kind of performance art crossed\\nwith politics. The average length of a political campaign speech in the\\nUnited States fell from an hour to just ten minutes.\\nAnd there was no better performer than Franklin Delano Roosevelt,\\nelected president in 1932. He used his weekly Fireside Chats to reach\\ndirectly into the homes of millions of citizens. (After the December 7, 1941,\\nPearl Harbor attack, four -fifths of American households listened to his\\nspeech live.) In so doing, he successfully went over the heads of the\\npolitical bosses and newspaper editors who fought to deny him a third and\\nfourth term. So powerful were FDR’ s speeches that on the night of an\\nimportant speech intended to rally listeners against Germany , the Nazis\\nlaunched a heavy bombing raid against London to try to divert the news.\\nBut radio also unleashed new political horrors. “It would not have been\\npossible for us to take power or to use it in the ways we have without the\\nradio,” said Joseph Goebbels, who himself was something new to\\ngovernment, the minister of propaganda for Nazi Germany . Goebbels\\nemployed nearly a thousand propagandists to push Adolf Hitler ’ s brutal,\\nincendiary , enrapturing speeches. Aiding the ef fort was a giveaway with a\\ncatch: German citizens were gifted special radios marked with swastikas,\\nwhich could only receive Nazi-broadcasted frequencies.\\nJust like the telegraph, radio would be used to foment war and become a\\nnew tool for fighting it. On the eve of the 1939 German invasion of Poland,\\nHitler told his generals, “I will provide a propagandistic casus belli.  Its\\ncredibility doesn’ t matter .

He would be a millionaire before he set foot on campus again and a\\nbillionaire soon thereafter .\\nT alented and entrepreneurial though Zuckerber g was, these qualities\\nalone aren’ t enough to explain his success. What he had in greatest\\nabundance—what all  of history’ s great inventors have had—was perfect\\ntiming.\\nFacebook, after all, was hardly the first social network. From the humble\\nbeginnings of SF-lovers, the 1980s and early 1990s had seen all manner of\\nonline bulletin boards and message groups. As the internet went\\ncommercial and growth exploded, people started to explore how to profit\\nfrom our willingness, and perhaps our need, to share. This was the start of\\n“social media”—platforms designed around the idea that an expanding\\nnetwork of users might create and share the content in an endless (and\\nendlessly lucrative) cycle.\\nThe first company dedicated to creating an online platform for personal\\nrelationships was launched in 1997. Six Degrees was based on the idea first\\nproposed in sociology studies that there were no more than six degrees of\\nseparation between any two people in the world. On this new site, you\\ncould maintain lists of friends, post items to a shared bulletin board, and\\neven expand your network to second- and third-degree connections. At its\\npeak, Six Degrees boasted 3.5 million registered members. But internet use\\nwas still too scattered for the network to grow at scale, and web browsers\\nwere still too primitive to realize many of the architects’ loftiest ambitions.\\nThrough the late 1990s, a wave of such new online services were created.\\nEarly dating sites like Match.com  essentially applied the eBay model to the\\nworld of dating, where you would shop in a marketplace for potential\\nmates. Massively multiplayer online role-playing games (MMORPGs) rose\\nto prominence with the 1997 Ultima series, allowing users to form warring\\nclans. And in 1999, a young programmer launched LiveJournal, which\\nof fered access to dynamic, online diaries. These journals would first be\\ncalled “weblogs,” which was soon shortened to “blogs.” All of these\\nnetworks would bloom (within ten years, there were more than 100 million', metadata={'source': 'Like_War_The_Weaponization_of_Social_Media.pdf', 'page': 49}),\n",

Y et the crash also had the\\nsame regenerative ef fect as a forest fire. It paved the way for a new\\ngeneration of digital services, building atop the charred remains of the old.\\nEven as W all Street retreated from Silicon V alley , the internet continued\\nits extraordinary growth. The 360 million internet users at the turn of the\\nmillennium had grown to roughly 820 million in 2004, when Facebook was\\nlaunched. Meanwhile, connection speed was improving by about 50 percent\\neach year . The telephone-based modem, whose iconic dial-up sound had\\ncharacterized and frustrated users’ experiences, was dying a welcome death,\\nreplaced by fast broadband. Pictures and video, which had once taken\\nminutes or even hours to download, now took seconds.\\nMost important of all was the steady evolution of HTML and other web\\ndevelopment languages that governed the internet’ s fundamen tal\\ncapabilities. The first internet browsers were pieces of software that\\nprovided a gateway into an essentially static W orld W ide W eb. V isitors\\ncould jump from page to page of a website, but rarely could they change\\nwhat was written on those pages. Increasingly , however , websites could\\nprocess user commands; access and update vast databases; and even\\ncustomize users’ experience based on hundreds or thousands of variables.\\nT o input a Google search, for instance, was essentially to borrow one of the\\nworld’ s mightiest supercomputers and have it spin up server farms across\\nthe world, just to help you find out who was the voice of Salem the cat in\\nSabrina, the T eenage W itch  (it was Nick Bakay).

They envisioned a platform with millions of public\\nvoices spinning the story of their lives in 140-character bursts (the number\\ncame from the 160-character limitation imposed by SMS mobile texting\\nminus 20 characters for a URL). This reflected the new sense that it was the\\nnetwork, rather than the content on it, that mattered. As T witter cofounder\\nJack Dorsey explained, “W e looked in the dictionary . . . and we came\\nacross the word ‘twitter ,’ and it was just perfect. The definition was a ‘short\\nburst of inconsequential information,’ and ‘chirps of birds.’ And that’ s\\nexactly what the product was.”\\nAs smartphone use grew , so did T witter .

Journalists took to using social media to record notes and trade\\ninformation, sharing the construction of their stories in real time. As they\\nreceived instant feedback, T witter became, in the words of tech reporter\\nFarhad Manjoo, “a place.” It was akin to a clubhouse for everyone, “where\\nmany journalists unconsciously build and gut-check a worldview .” The\\nsocial network had become where people decided what merited news\\ncoverage and what didn’ t.\\nT witter also of fered a means for those being reported on to bypass\\njournalists.

Easy to view and share, Sidarth’ s video\\nwent viral, with hundreds of thousands of people seeing it firsthand online,\\nand the news media being able to report on and link to it.\\nAllen’ s advisors, skilled and experienced in the old model of political\\ncampaigning, were flummoxed. At first they denied that the incident had\\nhappened. Then they claimed that Allen had done nothing wrong,\\nexplaining that “Macaca” wasn’ t meant as a slur . And then they pivoted to\\nclaiming that Allen had actually said “Mohawk,” referring to Sidarth’ s hair .\\nThe problem with each explanation was that, unlike in the past, anyone\\nwho wanted to could now see the evidence for themselves. They could click\\n“play” and hear the ugly word again and again. They could see that Allen\\nwas using it to describe the one brown-skinned person in a crowd of white\\npeople and suggesting that Sidarth wasn’ t a “real” American.\\nAllen’ s lead in the polls plummeted, and he went on to lose a race in\\nwhich his victory had been all but guaranteed. Instead of making a run for\\npresident, he never served in elected of fice again.

The Norte  newspaper in Juárez took the\\nsecond route, avoiding stories that might anger the state’ s secret cartel\\noverseers. As one editor explained, “Y ou do it or you die, and nobody wants\\nto die. Auto Censura —self-censorship—that’ s our shield.” But even that\\nwasn’ t enough to hold the cartels at bay .

Her home state of\\nT amaulipas had been split between two gangs, the Gulf Cartel and the\\nZetas, whose war had killed over 15,000 people. Faced with this ongoing\\nhorror , she and a small group of online vigilantes banded together to form\\nan or ganization to inform and protect their fellow citizens. They called it\\nV alor por T amaulipas (Courage for T amaulipas).

This success, though, marked Felina as a tar get. A cartel of fered a\\nreward of 600,000 pesos (about $48,000 at the time) for the identities of the\\nsite’ s anonymous administrators. It even posted its own message to the\\ncitizen journalists’ feed: “W e’re coming very close to many of you . . .\\nwatch out felina.”\\nFelina was undeterred.

Getting the message, Durov sold his shares in the\\ncompany to a Putin crony and fled the country .\\nOver time, such harsh policing of online speech actually becomes less\\nnecessary as self-censorship kicks in. Communications scholars call it the\\n“spiral of silence.” Humans continually test their beliefs against those of the\\nperceived majority and often quietly moderate their most extreme positions\\nin order to get along better with society as a whole. By creating an\\natmosphere in which certain views are stigmatized, governments are able to\\nshape what the majority opinion appears to be, which helps steer the\\ndirection of actual  majority opinion.\\nAlthough plenty of dissenters still exist in authoritarian states, like those\\nseeking to circumvent web bans and throttling, they now have to work\\nharder .

The\\ncountry’ s modern history is defined by two critical periods: a century’ s\\nworth of embarrassment, invasion, and exploitation by outside nations, and\\na subsequent series of revolutions that unleashed a blend of communism\\nand Chinese nationalism.

In 1993, when the network began to be\\nseen as something potentially important, of ficials banned all international\\nconnections that did not pass through a handful of state-run\\ntelecommunications companies.

As groups of like-\\nminded people clump together , they grow to resemble fanatical tribes,\\ntrapped in echo chambers of their own design. The reason is basic human\\nnature. In numerous studies, across numerous countries, involving millions\\nof people, researchers have discovered a cardinal rule that explains how\\ninformation disseminates across the internet, as well as how it shapes our\\npolitics, media, and wars. The best predictor is not accuracy or even\\ncontent; it is the number of friends who share the content first. They are\\nmore likely to believe what it says—and then to share it with others who, in\\nturn, will believe what they  say . It is all about us, or rather our love of\\nourselves and people like us.\\nThis phenomenon is called “homophily ,” meaning “love of the same.”\\nHomophily is what makes humans social creatures, able to congregate in\\nsuch lar ge and like-minded groups. It explains the growth of civilization\\nand cultures. It is also the reason an internet falsehood, once it begins to\\nspread, can rarely be stopped.\\nHomophily is an inescapable fact of online life. If you’ve ever shared a\\npiece of content after seeing it on a friend’ s newsfeed, you’ve become part\\nof the process. Most people don’ t ponder deeply when they click “share.”\\nThey’re just passing on things that they find notable or that might sway\\nothers. Y et it shapes them all the same. As users respond positively to\\ncertain types of content, the algorithms that drive social media’ s newsfeeds\\nensure that they see more of it. As they see more, they share more, af fecting\\nall others in their extended network. Like rip ples in a pond, each of these\\nsmall decisions expands outward, altering the flow of information across\\nthe entire system.\\nBut there’ s a catch: these ripples also reverberate back toward you. When\\nyou decide to share a particular piece of content, you are not only\\ninfluencing the future information environment, you are also being\\ninfluenced by any information that has passed your way already .

A prime example is the anti-\\nvaccine movement, which claims that one of the most important discoveries\\nin human history is actually a vast conspiracy . The movement got its start in\\nthe 1960s but exploded in popularity along with social media. People with\\nradical but seemingly disparate views—those on the far left suspicious of\\npharmaceutical companies, the far right suspicious of the government, and\\nreligious fundamentalists suspicious of relying on anything but prayer—\\nfound common cause online. Across Facebook groups and alternative-\\nhealth websites, these “anti-vaxxers” shared made-up stories about the links\\nbetween childhood vaccination and autism, reveling in conspiracy theories\\nand claims they were the ones who faced a second “Holocaust.”\\nIn an endless feedback loop, each piece of content shared within the anti-\\nvaxxer community leaves them only more convinced that they  are the sane\\nones, defending their children against blasphemous, corporate-enriching,\\ngovernment-induced genetic engineering. In the process, the personalization\\naf forded by social media also becomes a weapon. Whenever they are\\nchallenged, anti-vaxxers tar get not just the counterar gument but also the\\nperson making it.

These failing stars used the attention-\\ngetting power of the anti-vaxxers to boost their personal brands—\\nmagnifying the reach of the conspiracy in the process.\\nIn the United States, the net result of this internet-enabled movement is\\nthat—after more than two centuries of proven, ef fective use and hundreds', metadata={'source': 'Like_War_The_Weaponization_of_Social_Media.pdf', 'page': 128}),\n",

In\\nCalifornia, the percentage of parents applying a “personal belief exception”\\nto avoid vaccinating their kinder gartners quadrupled between 2000 and\\n2013, and disease transmittal rates among kids soared as a result. Cases of\\nchildhood illnesses like whooping cough reached a sixty-year high, while\\nthe Disneyland resort was rocked by an outbreak of measles that sickened\\n147 children.

Put\\nsimply , people like to be right; they hate  to be proven wrong. In the 1960s,\\nan English psychologist isolated this phenomenon and put a name to it:\\n“confirmation bias.” Other psychologists then discovered that trying to fight\\nconfirmation bias by demonstrating people’ s errors often made the problem\\nworse. The more you explain with facts that someone is mistaken, the more\\nthey dig in their heels.\\nWhat the internet does do is throw this process into overdrive, fueling the\\nbrain’ s worst impulses and then spreading them to countless others. Social\\nmedia transports users to a world in which their every view seems widely\\nshared. It helps them find others just like them. Af ter a group is formed, the\\npower of homophily then knits it ever closer together . U.S. Army colonel\\nturned historian Robert Bateman summarizes it pointedly: “Once, every\\nvillage had an idiot. It took the internet to bring them all together .”\\nThanks to this combination of internet-accelerated homophily and\\nconfirmation bias, civil society can be torn into fragments. Each group\\ncomes to believe that only its  members know the truth and that all others\\nare ignorant or , even worse, evil. In fragile states, the situation can become\\nuntenable.

The first was a set of beliefs that, as the\\nAssociated Press put it, rejected “the American democratic ideal that all\\nshould have equality under the law regardless of creed, gender , ethnic origin\\nor race.” The second was a recognition that social media was the best\\nmeans to transform that conviction into reality .\\nStoking outrage and seeking attention, Bannon declared Breitbart “the\\nplatform for the alt-right.” Its editors even invited the movements’ leaders\\nto edit their own glowing profile articles.

The first rule is simplicity .  In 2000,\\nthe average attention span of an internet user was measured at twelve\\nseconds. By 2015, it had shrunk to eight seconds—slightly less than the\\naverage attention span of a goldfish. An ef fective digital narrative,\\ntherefore, is one that can be absorbed almost instantly .\\nThis is where the simple, direct hip-hop vernacular of Junaid Hussain\\nproved so ef fective in reaching out to millennial youth, compared with the\\nbook-length treatises of earlier jihadist recruiters. Donald T rump also\\ncapitalized on the premium that social media places on simplicity . During\\nthe 2016 election, Carnegie Mellon University researchers studied and\\nranked the complexity of the candidates’ language (giving it what is known\\nas a Flesch-Kincaid score). They found that T rump’ s vocabulary measured\\nat the lowest level of all the candidates, comprehensible to someone with a\\nfifth-grade education.\\nThis phenomenon might seem unprecedented, but it is consistent with a\\nlar ger historic pattern. Starting with Geor ge W ashington’ s first inaugural\\naddress, which measured as one of the most complex overall, American\\npresidents communicated at a college level only when newspapers\\ndominated mass communication. But each time a new technol ogy took\\nhold, the complexity score dipped. It started with the advent of radio in the\\n1920s, and again with the entry of television in the 1950s, and now once\\nmore with social media. T o put it another way: the more accessible the\\ntechnology , the simpler a winning voice becomes. It may be Sad! But it is\\nT rue!\\nThis explains why so many modern narratives exist at least partially in\\nimages. Pictures are not just worth the proverbial thousand words; they\\ndeliver the point quickly .

It is fast, evocative, and\\n(most important) easily shared. It is also influential, helping inspire the\\nSharknado  franchise.\\nThe second rule of narrative is r esonance.  Nearly all ef fective narratives\\nconform to what social scientists call “frames,” products of particular\\nlanguage and culture that feel instantly and deeply familiar . In the American\\nexperience, think of plotlines like “rebel without a cause” or “small-town\\nkid trying to make it in the big city .” Some frames are so common and\\nenduring that they might well be hardwired into our brains.

Quite often, these frames can mer ge\\nwith the real-life narratives our brains construct to explain ourselves and the\\nworld around us. A resonant narrative is one that fits neatly into our\\npreexisting story lines by allowing us to see ourselves clearly in solidarity\\nwith—or opposition to—its actors. Social media can prove irresistible in\\nthis process by allowing us to join in the narrative, with the world watching.\\nSpencer and Heidi achieved resonance by being what every hero or\\nheroine needs—a villainous foe—which they played to caricature. Among\\nits opponents, ISIS achieved resonance by being similarly cartoonishly evil.\\nAmong its supporters, it achieved resonance by promising the mystery ,\\nadventure, or lofty purpose they’d been hoping for their entire lives. Even\\nfor members of Congress, there is a powerful correlation between their\\nlevel of online celebrity and a narrative of ideological extremism.\\nAccording to a study by the Pew Research Center , the more unyieldingly\\nhyperpartisan a member of Congress is—best fitting our concept of the\\ncharacters in a partisan play—the more T witter followers he or she draws.\\nThis also explains why conspiracy theories have found new life on the\\ninternet.

S.

What\\ncaptures the most attention on social media isn’ t content that makes a\\nprofound ar gument or expands viewers’ intellectual horizons. Instead, it is\\ncontent that stirs emotions. Amusement, shock, and outrage determine how\\nquickly and how far a given piece of information will spread through a\\nsocial network. Or , in simpler terms, content that can be labeled “LOL,”\\n“OMG,” or “WTF .”\\nThese are the sorts of feelings that create ar ousal,  not the sexual kind (at\\nleast not usually), but the kind in which the heart beats faster and the body\\nsur ges with fresh ener gy . Arousal can be positive or negative. A baby\\ndancing, a politician standing up for what she believes in, the story of a\\ndisabled man being robbed and beaten, and an awful flight delay are things\\nthat people will likely consume and forward to others in their network. A\\ndecade’ s worth of psychology and marketing studies, con ducted across\\nhundreds of thousands of social media users, have arrived at the same\\nsimple conclusion: the stronger the emotions involved, the likelier\\nsomething is to go viral.\\nBut the findings go further . In 2013, Chinese data scientists conducted an\\nexhaustive study of conversations on the social media platform W eibo.\\nAnalyzing 70 million messages spread across 200,000 users, they\\ndiscovered that anger  was the emotion that traveled fastest and farthest\\nthrough the social network—and the competition wasn’ t even close. “Anger\\nis more influential than other emotions like joy ,” the researchers bluntly\\nconcluded. Because social media users were linked to so many others who\\nthought and felt as they did, a single instance of outrage could tear through\\nan online community like wildfire. “The angry mood delivered through\\nsocial ties could boost the spread of the corresponding news and speed up\\nthe formation of public opinion and collective behavior ,” the researchers', metadata={'source': 'Like_War_The_Weaponization_of_Social_Media.pdf', 'page': 164}),\n",

People who hadn’ t been angry before, seeing so much anger around\\nthem, feel inclined to ramp up their language and join in the fury .\\nA year later , an even lar ger and more insidious study confirmed the\\npower of anger . Partnering with Facebook, data scientists manipulated the\\nnewsfeeds of nearly 700,000 users over the course of a week, without the\\nknowledge of the “participants.” For some, the researchers increased the\\nnumber of positive stories to which they were exposed. For others, they\\nincreased the number of negative stories. In each case, Facebook users\\naltered their own behavior to match their new apparent reality , becoming\\ncheerier or angrier in the process. But the ef fect was most pronounced\\namong those whose newsfeeds had turned negative. The scientists dubbed\\nthis an “emotional contagion,” the spread of emotions through social\\nnetworks that resembled nothing so much as the transmission of a virus.\\n“Emotional contagion occurs without direct interaction between people,”\\nthe scientists concluded, “and in the complete absence of nonverbal cues.”\\nJust seeing repeated messages of joy or outrage was enough to make people\\nfeel those emotions themselves.\\nAnger remains the most potent emotion, in part because it is the most\\ninteractive. As social media users find ways to express (or exploit) anger ,\\nthey generate new pieces of content that are propelled through the same\\nsystem, setting of f additional cascades of fury . When an issue has two sides\\n—as it almost always does—it can resemble a perpetual-mo tion machine of\\noutrage. The graphic online propaganda of ISIS, for instance, served a dual\\npurpose. Not only did it elicit waves of shock and outrage in the W est; it\\nalso drove a violent anti-Islamic backlash, which ISIS could use to fuel\\nrenewed anger and resolve among its own recruits.\\nAnger is not necessarily bad. After all, nearly every political movement\\nthat has risen to prominence in the social media age has done so by\\nharnessing the power of outrage. Sometimes, activists fight for better\\ngovernment policy , using a single, viral moment as their rallying cry: a\\ndeadly 201 1 train derailment in Zhejiang, China; a massive 2017 apartment\\nbuilding fire in London; or a 2018 school shooting in Parkland, Florida.\\nOther times, the cause is social or racial justice. In 2013, Alicia Garza\\nposted a passionate message about police shootings of African Americans\\non her Facebook page. She closed it with a simple note: “Black people. I\\nlove you. I love us.

If\\neager , inexperienced enemy pilots took the bait and moved to attack, the\\nAmericans’ superior engines would suddenly roar into action, and the aces\\nwould turn to shoot down their foes.

The newbies would then waste time trying to ar gue a\\npoint that was simply designed to make them ar gue. An article from a\\ndigital magazine of the time succinctly described the appeal of trolling: “If\\nyou don’ t fall for the joke, you get to be in on it.”\\nWhile early trolling was characterized by wink-and-nudge humor , as\\nmore and more people (and real-life problems) penetrated digital\\nsanctuaries, the good-natured joking part soon died. T oday , we know trolls\\nas those internet users who post messages that are less about sharing\\ninformation than spreading anger . Their specific goal is to provoke a furious\\nresponse.

A lonely girl in W ashington State—a volunteer Sunday\\nschool teacher and part-time babysitter—described how ISIS recruiters\\ngave her the attentive friends she’d always craved. (Only a sharp-eyed\\ngrandmother stopped her from boarding a plane to Syria.) ISIS promised\\nadventure and a sense of belonging. “It’ s a closed community—almost a\\nclique,” explained terrorism analyst Seamus Hughes. “They share memes\\nand inside jokes, terms and phrases you’d only know if you were a\\nfollower .”\\nIn each case, recruits to extremist causes are lured by a warmth and\\ncamaraderie that seems lacking in their own lonely lives. In each case, such\\nrecruits build communities that attract people from across the world but that\\nshow almost no diversity of thought. “Isolation may be the beginning of\\nterror ,” political theorist Hannah Arendt wrote in a 1953 essay about the\\norigins of totalitarianism. “It certainly is its most fertile ground.” If people\\ncome to believe that their radical notions are unassailably true—and if they\\nbelieve that only other people who share the same opinions are “real” or\\nworth protecting—they open the door to violence and bloodshed.\\nNot by coincidence, the field of study that seeks to counter this process\\nof radicalization, known as countering violent extremism (CVE), also\\nfocuses on the powers of community-building. Farah Pandith is a pioneer of\\nthis field. Born in the restive Kashmir region of India, Pandith moved to\\nMassachusetts as a young girl. T wo moments changed the trajectory of her\\nlife. One took place at Smith College, where as a student in 1989 Pandith\\ngave a speech attended by school alumnae, including Barbara Bush. The\\nFirst Lady was impressed and soon became her pen pal. The other occurred\\na few years later , back in her birthplace of Srinagar , Kashmir . One family\\nmember , who was working to bring peace to the region, was assassinated by\\nextremists.

She foresaw a crisis of identity that would soon sweep the\\nMiddle East, culminating in the rise of ISIS. But she also saw something\\nelse. “Only peer -to-peer relations can change minds,” she concluded. The\\nonly way to prevent radicalization was to assemble a crowd of authentic\\nvoices to fight back.\\nPandith determined that social media would be the key battleground in\\nthis fight. She became one of the first high-level U.S. of ficials to use\\nFacebook in her work. She learned that it was not just a megaphone but also\\na means to keep her connected to the youth she met around the world, and,\\neven more important, to connect them with each other . “Because I was fully\\nfocusing on millennials, I needed to be able to show them in real time what\\nI was hearing from others,” she explained. “I wanted to connect the kid I\\nmet in Germany with a kid in Australia. The conversation I was having in\\nMauritania with the cool thing in the Pamir mountains [of T ajikistan] that\\nthey were doing.” Each could become an ally to the other—and part of a\\nbroad collective to push back against the specter of extremism.\\nFrustrated by a bureaucracy that couldn’ t get out of its own way and\\nrealizing that a teenager ’ s heart and mind are places where “no government\\nis credible,” Pandith has since left government.

In recent years, a number of these sorts of CVE\\nor ganizations have arisen. There’ s the Online Civil Courage Initiative,\\nwhich links more than a hundred anti-hate or ganizations across Europe, and\\nGen Next, which seeks to “deprogram” former jihadists.

At the center was Project Alamo, named for its election last-stand\\nlocation in T exas. A 100-person team, aided by embedded social media\\ncompany employees, drew upon a database whose size and depth would\\ncome to dwarf all other campaign operations that had come before it.

As opposed to a TV or print ad that could run in only one form at a\\ntime, the campaign would regularly run thousands of variations of an online\\noutreach ef fort simultaneously .

It made little sense that a cartoon frog had become a\\nstandard-bearer for a white ethno-state, or a campaign symbol or tool of\\ninternational diplomacy .\\nBut it was never about the frog.

Pepe was also the product\\nof a conflict of reinvention and appropriation that twisted him in directions\\nthat no one might have expected. In understanding Pepe, one can\\nunderstand memes, and through them the life cycle of ideas on the internet.\\nPepe the Frog was born in 2005 to the San Francisco–based artist Matt\\nFurie. One of four teenage monsters in Furie’ s Boy’ s Club comic series,\\nPepe was just a cartoon layabout who spent his days “drinkin’, stinkin’, and\\nnever thinkin’.” In 2008, an anonymous 4chan user shared a panel in which\\nPepe pulled his pants down to his ankles to urinate in a public bathroom,\\nalong with his shameless explanation for doing so: “Feels good man.”\\nPepe’ s simplicity and irreverence perfectly captured the spirit of the\\nfreewheeling, profane 4chan community . He went viral among internet\\nforum users and—more impressively— surpassed  virality to become part of\\nthe underlying culture of the internet. When the original meme seemed\\nexhausted, users mined Furie’ s comics for more drawings. When the comics\\nran out, users began to make their own. In a sense, Pepe became the ideal\\nonline phenomenon—popular and endlessly adaptable, while remaining too\\nweird and unattractive to ever go fully mainstream.\\nW ith these attributes, it was not much of a shock when Pepe became the\\nunof ficial mascot of 4chan’ s /pol/ politics board. When these trolls went to\\nbattle for T rump, they took Pepe with them. What began as a mockery of\\npolitical activism soon became, for many of these users, a serious ef fort to\\nhelp T rump win. At the same time, clusters of traditional T rump supporters\\nbegan to adopt the same mannerisms and tactics as actual trolls. As a result,\\nPepe underwent another transformation. The meme was still dumb and\\nirreverent, but now he was suf fused with political  meaning as well. Pepe\\nhad entered the real world, with real consequences.\\nAmidst the election excitement, there was another , darker battle raging\\nfor Pepe’ s soul. It was led (or so they wanted you to believe) by a group of\\nthirty “shitposters” and casual bodybuilders, who feared that their meme\\nwas being co-opted by “normies,” people with no appreciation of the\\ninternet’ s subterranean culture.

In a tactic that\\nwould become commonplace, they also tar geted unwitting reporters,\\nbombarding them with Pepe-related hate speech in order to convince them\\nthat the meme was a white supremacist and anti-Semitic. The gambit\\nworked. Pepe became inextricably linked to white nationalism, denounced\\nby most journalists and the American left and embraced unironically by\\nactual  neo-Nazis, who finally had a “hip” symbol to call their own. The\\nnotorious white supremacist leader Richard Spencer even took to wearing a\\nlapel pin of Pepe in public, and in an instantly viral video tried to explain its\\nsymbolic value to his cause—until a passerby punched him in the face.\\nT rump’ s troll army wielded Pepe like a weapon, poking and prodding at\\nmainstream journalists and Clinton supporters, trying to elicit a backlash.\\nThe moment they were called out as racist or white supremacist, they\\nreplied with smug outrage, asking how in the world  a cartoon could be\\nconstrued as anything more than a silly , dumb frog.\\nPepe formed an ideological bridge between trolling and the next-\\ngeneration white nationalist, alt-right movement that had lined up behind\\nT rump. Third Reich phrases like “blood and soil,” filtered through Pepe\\nmemes, fit surprisingly well with T rump’ s America First, anti-immigrant,\\nanti-Islamic campaign platform. The wink and nod of a cartoon frog\\nallowed a rich, but easily deniable, symbolism.\\nWhen T rump won, Pepe transformed again.

In truth, Pepe was a prism, a symbol\\ncontinually reinterpreted and repurposed by internet pranksters, T rump\\nsupporters, liberal activists, ultranationalists, and everyone who just\\nhappened to glimpse him in passing. Pepe was a “meme,” an empty vessel,\\nlike the chromatin that shields DNA; a protective layer over a rich, ever -\\nmultiplying strand of ideas. As it was with Pepe, so it is with all memes.\\nThey are the vessels by which culture is transmitted—and a crucial\\ninstrument by which LikeW ar is fought.\\nY et the concept  of memes has nothing to do with the internet. In the late\\n1960s, biologists had begun to unravel the basic nature of the genetic code,\\ndiscovering how cellular instructions are passed from one generation to the\\nnext. Flush with excitement, they pondered whether their work could be\\napplied more broadly . If the rules of genetics could explain life, could they\\nnot explain many other things—even the nature of information? After all,\\njust as biological life had to ceaselessly copy itself in order to survive, ideas\\nhad to do so, too. In his 1976 book The Selfish Gene,  evolutionary biologist\\nRichard Dawkins put a name to these bits of or ganic, self-multiplying\\ninformation: “memes.”\\n“The computers in which memes live are human brains,” Dawkins wrote.\\nMemes are born from human culture and shaped and transmitted by\\nlanguage. Over time, a meme might become increasingly self-referential\\nand complex, spawning clusters of new  memes. A meme is “alive” only so\\nlong as it exists in the human mind. For a meme to be for gotten means that\\nit goes extinct, the same as a species that can no longer pass on its genetic\\ncode.\\nReligion, for instance, can be viewed as a series of memes both broad\\nand narrow: a general belief in a higher power to the more specific\\ncatechisms of the Christian faith to even the warping of a religion to push\\nbigotry against members of another faith. For example, one of history’ s\\ncruelest and most enduring memes is the web of conspiracy theories that\\ninfuse anti-Semitism. The belief in a secret Jewish conspiracy aiming to run\\nthe world built upon itself from the Middle Ages to a fake pamphlet created\\nby Russian secret police in 1903 ( The Pr otocols of the Meetings of the\\nLearned Elders of Zion ) to the pamphlet’ s mass printing and distribution in\\nAmerica by Henry Ford and its subsequent use in Nazi propaganda in\\nGermany .', metadata={'source': 'Like_War_The_Weaponization_of_Social_Media.pdf', 'page': 191}),\n",

Dawkins, who\\nhad picked up programming as a hobby , observed as much in The Selfish\\nGene ’ s 1989 edition. “It was obviously predictable that manufactured\\nelectronic computers, too, would eventually play host to self-replicating\\npatterns of information—memes,” he wrote. “. . . It is a perfect milieu for\\nself-replicating programs to flourish and spread.”\\nThrough the 1990s, memes proliferated across the chaotic, emer ging\\nnetwork of websites and forum boards. Longstanding memes (like anti-\\nSemitic conspiracy theories) found fresh, receptive audiences. Meanwhile,\\nentirely new memes could seize popular attention. “The internet is a first\\nclass ecology for memes,” Dawkins observed in 2014. By this point,\\nDawkins himself had become something of a meme—as an uber -rational,\\ndyspeptic, atheistic defender of Reason, he managed to transform himself\\ninto a toxic T witter troll.\\nAs the web became more image- and social media–friendly , what we\\nknow as the “internet meme” was born. These were images or short GIFs,\\noften overlaid with text and easily shareable, that relayed ideas fast.\\nGrasping their full meaning, however , required understanding not only the\\ncontent at hand but also its previous iterations. For instance, the LOLCats\\nphenomenon, comprised of tens of thousands of cat pictures with\\nmisspelled captions, becomes funnier (to a point) only if you’re familiar\\nwith the context to which it refers—the pervasiveness of cat images on the\\ninternet. Indeed, the most ef fective memes often build not merely on\\nthemselves but on other memes as well. One reason for Pepe the Frog’ s\\nenduring popularity was the way he could be used to mock or replicate\\nother viral content—to essentially “meme” memes.\\nImportantly , it takes only one event, group, or person to alter a meme’ s\\nmeaning for everyone who might use it. “Digital content can travel further ,\\nbe decontextualized more quickly and accessed instantaneously—without\\nthe original creator ’ s consent or even awareness—by millions of people,”\\nwrite internet ethicists Whitney Phillips and R yan Milner . Pepe the Frog’ s\\ncreator went so far as to sue to try to stop the misuse of his creation. But it\\nwas to no avail. By either hijacking or chance, a meme can come to contain\\nvastly dif ferent ideas than those that inspired it, even as it retains all its old\\nreach and influence.

In 2007, Israel established a formal “information\\ndirectorate,” and in 2009 it became the first democratic nation to fund an\\n“internet warfare squad” to respond to hostile blog comments.\\nNonetheless, even Israel was caught of f guard by the magnitude of the\\nsocial media revolution. The critical moment came in 2010, when human\\nrights activists or ganized the heavily publicized Freedom Flotilla to bring\\nsupplies to Gaza, then under Israeli blockade.

Whenever these companies have had to reckon with a political,\\nsocial, or ethical dilemma—ironically spawned by their platforms’ very\\nsuccess—they often grasp for another new technology to solve it.

While 1995 was a banner year\\nfor the internet, as the U.S. government of ficially relinquished control and\\nmillions of new users jumped online, in Congress this excitement gave way\\nto moral panic. Thanks to one viral story and an audience of mostly tech-\\nilliterate legislators, the internet now meant only one thing: pornography .\\n“The information superhighway should not become a red-light district!”\\nbellowed Senator James Exon, an elderly Democrat from Nebraska. He\\nintroduced the Communications Decency Act (CDA), which made it a\\ncrime to “send to or display in a manner available to” those under 18 years\\nof age any communication that depicted “sexual or excretory activities . . .\\nregardless of whether the user of such service placed the call or initiated the\\ncommunication.” The punishment was two years in prison and a fine of\\n$100,000.

T wo younger U.S.\\nrepresentatives—Chris Cox, a Republican from California, and Ron W yden,\\na Democrat from Oregon—realized that unless something was done to\\nprotect websites that tried to police their own networks, the entire internet\\nwould be paralyzed by fear of lawsuits and prison time. Their consequent\\namendment became 47 U.S.C. § 230 (1996), known as Section 230. It was,\\nin the words of W ir ed  magazine, “the most important law in tech.”\\nSection 230 provided “protection for ‘Good Samaritan’ blocking and\\nscreening of of fensive material,” essentially ruling that no website could be\\nheld accountable for the speech of its users. And no website that made a\\n“good-faith” ef fort to enforce applicable U.S. regulations could be\\npunished, even if its ef forts fell short.

The\\nonly part of the CDA that survived was Section 230. Over the ensuing\\nyears, it would be consistently challenged and upheld. W ith each successful\\ndefense, its legal standing grew stronger . Outside of two specific\\nexemptions (federal criminal law and intellectual property), the internet was\\nmostly left to govern itself. As a result, most early corporate censorship—\\nmore politely known as “content moderation”—would come not because of\\ngovernment mandate, but to avoid involving government in the first place.\\nAs ever , money was the driver . Over the next decade, questions regarding\\nwhat constituted permissible online speech centered not on politics or\\npropriety , but on property . Blogger (eventually acquired by Google), for\\nexample, was an early self-publishing hub that enabled millions of users to\\nset up websites free of char ge. And yet a visitor to Blogger ’ s home page in\\n1999 would find no list of rules, only a friendly reminder to properly\\nconfigure your URL so you could be added to the master blog roll. Some\\nblogs might host racist rants and pornography , the thinking went, but so\\nwhat? This wasn’ t a problem—it was the whole reason services like\\nBlogger existed: to share the panoply of human expression, emotions, and\\nbeliefs.\\nBy contrast, violations of intellectual property rights were covered not by\\nthe permissive Section 230, but by the much stricter 1998 Digital\\nMillennium Copyright Act (DMCA). This law imposed a maximum prison\\nsentence of five years or a fine of $500,000 for the first  of fense of posting\\nmaterial for which someone else held a copyright. Fortunately , much like\\nSection 230, the law also included a “safe harbor” provision.

It was a sign of things to come.\\nIn another sign of things to come, the automated system went too far ,\\ndisabling videos that contained even an incidental glimpse of copyrighted\\nmaterial. Just a few wayward seconds—like Katy Perry’ s “I Kissed a Girl”\\nplaying in the background of a video shot in a crowded bar—was enough to\\nnuke a whole clip. In 2008, Republican presidential candidate John McCain\\ncomplained that his political ads were being automatically removed because\\nthey contained brief clips from broadcast news. Digital rights activists\\ngleefully reminded McCain that he’d voted the DMCA into law a decade\\nearlier .\\nHappily , a small reprieve from copyright laws would arrive later that\\nyear , following an epic legal battle between the artist formerly known as\\nPrince and a 13-month-old baby . The baby had been marked as a “copyright\\nviolator” after his mother uploaded a video of him pushing a toy stroller and\\nlaughing as Prince’ s “Let’ s Go Crazy” played for precisely twenty seconds\\nin the background. The judicial ruling found, essentially , that the whole\\nthing was ridiculous and that internet users had a right to plead “fair use”\\nbefore their content was eradicated. Y ouT ube’ s copyright-snif fing algorithm\\nwas allowed to relax—but not much.\\nEven as they strengthened their copyright controls, however , emer ging\\nsocial media titans confronted a far more horrifying problem: child\\npornography . Under Section 230, websites enjoyed broad legal immunity\\nagainst char ges of child abuse or exploitation. But use of a platform by\\nchild porn distributors wasn’ t just a legal problem; it was a moral\\nim perative, one whose mere mention could sink a company’ s reputation.

So, too, in The Matrix,  every person\\nhas a choice. Y ou can pick a red pill (itself now an internet meme) that\\nof fers the truth. Or you can pick a blue pill, which allows you to “believe\\nwhatever you want to believe.”\\nSocial media is extraordinarily powerful, but also easily accessible and\\npliable. Across it play out battles for not just every issue you care about, but\\nfor the future itself. Y et within this network, and in each of the conflicts on\\nit, we all still have the power of choice. Not only do we determine what role\\nwe play , but we also influence what others know and do, shaping the\\noutcomes of all these battles. In this new world, the same basic law applies\\nto us all:\\nY ou are now what you share.\\nAnd through what you choose, you share who you truly are.', metadata={'source': 'Like_War_The_Weaponization_of_Social_Media.pdf', 'page': 272}),\n",

This particular pocket of the Mariana T rench belonged to\\nhim alone.\\nZhu guided the course underwater with a series of gentle tilts of the softly\\nglowing control-sleeve gloves he wore.

No other nation had even attempted to plumb the\\ndepths of the sea like Zhu and his comrades, which was why 96 percent of\\nthe ocean floor still remained unexplored and unexploited. Indeed, the\\ntraining alone for the deep-sea dive had taken a full four years once the\\nteam at T ianjin University developed the submersible.3 Compared to that,\\nthe five days of searching on this mission was nothing.\\nThis descent, with Zhu at the controls, was the mission’ s last shot. At\\nsome point soon, the team knew , the Americans would be paying them a\\n“friendly” visit, or maybe they would have the Australians do it for them.\\nThe Chinese were too close to the big U.S. base in Guam; it was a wonder\\nnobody had come to look into what they were doing yet.

He nudged the submersible\\non, sorting the deployments of the sub’ s disposable autonomous underwater\\nvehicles, which would allow the team to map the full extent of the\\ndiscovery . Each vessel was, in ef fect, a mini-torpedo whose sonic explosion\\naf forded the submersible’ s imaging-by-sound sensors a deeper\\nunderstanding of the riches beneath the sea floor . The sound waves allowed\\nthe computer to “see” the entirety of the field buried kilometers below the\\ncrust.
